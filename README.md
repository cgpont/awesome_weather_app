# awesome_weather_app
Very simple weather app (but awesome)

In order for this app to work, you have to include these 2 variables in the .env file:

  - Variable OPEN_MAPS_API_BASE_URL: value should be    api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

  - Variable OPEN_MAPS_API_ID: value should be the API ID you obtain when you sign up for a free subscription in the Openweathermap API.
